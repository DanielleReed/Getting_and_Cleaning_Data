This README applies to the assignment for the Coursera class

As a high-level overview, sensors were placed on people doing six different activities, and the data from these sensors were averaged over time periods and their means and SDs reported. The main point was to wrap the data correctly into one file and take the means and sd first over each time-window and then one grand mean (one row per person per activity).  

There is one script:

run_analysis.R

which generates two output files:
TidyData.txt
averages.txt

The variables in these files are described in the codebook:
Codebook.md

Thanks for grading my assignment.
